# Jungle Jump

This is a small platform game. The character's and bomb's animation is implemented by changing pictures every time the game window is refreshed.
All the game tileset is included in the [jungle](https://github.com/nandor23/platform-game/tree/main/jungle) folder.

The obstacles' position is read from a file, after all obstacles are passed you can still continue until you want, but on a flat surface. The map is updated dinamically, meaning that only the current obstacles are shown.
