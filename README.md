# Jungle Jump

This is a small platform game. The characters and bombs animation is implemented by changing pictures every time the character moves or the screen refreshes.
All tilesets used in the game are included in the [jungle](https://github.com/nandor23/platform-game/tree/main/jungle) folder.

The obstacles' position is read from a file, after all obstacles are passed you can still continue until you want, but on a flat surface. The map is updated dinamically, meaning that only the current obstacles are displayed.

There's also an option to save the current game or load an older one.
