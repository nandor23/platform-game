# Jungle Jump

This is a small platform game. The character and bomb animations are implemented by changing pictures every time the character moves or the screen refreshes.
All tilesets used in the game are included in the [jungle](https://github.com/nandor23/platform-game/tree/main/jungle) folder.

The obstacles' positions are read from a file, after all obstacles are passed, you can still continue playing, but only on a flat surface.Â The map is updated dinamically, meaning that only the visible obstacles are displayed.

There is also an option to save the current game or load an older one.
